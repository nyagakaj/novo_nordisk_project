GLP-1 Global Demand & Supply Intelligence Platform (Concept Project)

A digital business and forecasting concept inspired by insights from Novo Nordisk’s 2024 Annual Report.

Overview

This project explores how AI-inspired forecasting and digital decision-support tools can strengthen strategic planning for rapidly growing pharmaceutical therapies, particularly GLP-1 medicines for diabetes and obesity.

The prototype uses HTML, Bootstrap, and Chart.js to demonstrate how digital tools can support system-level thinking around demand forecasting, manufacturing capacity, and equitable global allocation. It uses simulated (dummy) data to keep the implementation lightweight and accessible.

This project forms part of my application to the Novo Nordisk Global Digital Business Graduate Programme (2026 intake).

Project Motivation

After reviewing Novo Nordisk’s 2024 Annual Report, one insight stood out: global demand for GLP-1 therapies is rising faster than manufacturing capacity can expand. This creates challenges related to forecasting, supply constraints, scenario planning, and equitable access.

This project demonstrates how a simple digital concept could help address these challenges and how predictive analytics might support better decision-making within global pharmaceutical operations.

Guiding Question:
What would a lightweight forecasting and scenario-analysis tool look like if applied to GLP-1 capacity and access challenges?

What the Prototype Demonstrates
Predictive Analytics (Conceptual)

A simulated demand forecast illustrates how future GLP-1 uptake could be projected.

Scenario Simulation (Conceptual)

Dummy data and placeholders show how different manufacturing or allocation scenarios might be compared.

Decision-Support Interface

A clean, responsive dashboard demonstrates how visual tools can make complex trade-offs more transparent.

System Thinking

The prototype connects forecasting, supply constraints, sustainability considerations, and allocation into one conceptual workflow.

Audit trails for forecasting decisions

About the Creator

I am a Master of Health Informatics candidate with experience building dashboards and data tools for public health decision-making at Africa CDC. This project reflects my interest in applying digital strategy, forecasting, and system thinking to real-world pharmaceutical challenges. It demonstrates how technology can act as an enabler for informed decision-making, equitable access, and sustainable growth.
